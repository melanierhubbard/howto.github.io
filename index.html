<h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The following is an instruction video on how to use Scalar for your Critical Methodology assignment. Below the video is the script and a few images for quick reference. </p>
<p>[embed]https://youtu.be/kop3VHf_PFI[/embed]</p><h1><strong>Signing into Scalar</strong></h1><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2229 size-full" src="http://dh.lmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-10-at-5.56.52-PM.png" alt="" width="128" height="130" />
<p>To sign in to Scalar you are going to use your LMU email address and the password given to you. Click on the person icon in the upper right corner of the page and sign in.</p>

<h1><strong>Accessing Your Project</strong></h1>
<p>To get to your project, click your name on the temporary table of contents page. All of your pages (your intro, your archival documents, and your works cited page) should be there already. If something is missing or wrong, let me know right away. All of these pages are connected by what is called a "path," which is function in Scalar. Let me know if you would like your archival documents in a different order.</p>

<h1><strong>Scalar Dashboard</strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2228 size-full" src="http://dh.lmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-10-at-5.57.06-PM.png" alt="" width="138" height="134" /></p><p>Scalar has a dashboard that might confuse you. If you end up here it’s probably because you accidentally click on the <strong>wrench icon</strong>. The dashboard is how you access a lot of things like the site’s media and pages, but you’re not going need to work in it. I have set up the site so that you only have to work in your exact pages. To get out of the dashboard and back to the regular site, click on <strong>“back to book”</strong> in the upper right corner.</p>

<h1><strong>Edit the Introduction and Works Cited Text</strong></h1>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2227 size-full" src="http://dh.lmu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-10-at-5.57.20-PM.png" alt="" width="148" height="134" /></p><p>To edit the text on your introduction and works cited pages, click on the <strong>pencil icon</strong> in the upper right corner. Adding and editing text in Scalar works like most other online tools. It's similar to Wordpress, for example.</p>

<h1><strong>Cutting and Pasting from a Word Doc</strong></h1><p>Because Word formatting is not always compatible with other tools, it is best to stripe the formatting. To do this click <strong>Source</strong>, found just above the text box on the left. Paste the text and then click <strong>Source</strong> again. When Source is selected you are seeing the raw text view.* When Sources is not selected, you are seeing the more visually friendly view, which is why I recommend you work with it unselected. Alternatively, you can cut and paste your Word doc text into a <strong>text editor</strong>. Macs have Text Edit and PC's have Notepad. And then you cut and paste that into Scalar.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">*This is for adding things like HTML.</p>
</div>
    </div>
<div class="w3-row">
    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
<h1><strong>Formatting Text</strong></h1>
<p>Once the text is cut and pasted into the text box you can format it. Like a typical text tool, Scalar lets you do things like add <em>italics</em> and <strong>boldface</strong>.</p>
</div>
    <div>
<div class="w3-row">
    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
<h1><strong>Save Your Work</strong></h1>
<p>Always save your work. If you select just “save” you will stay on the editing page. If you select “save and view” it will save the information and take you to the page view.</p>

<h1>
<strong>Annotations</strong></h1>
<p>To add and edit annotations, go to the archival document you want to annotate and click on the <strong>paper clip icon</strong> found in the upper right corner.</p>
<p>When you first land on the annotation page you’ll see that the image is really small. This is a flaw in Scalar. To work around it I recommend you zoom in the webpage. To zoom in and out of a web page on a <strong>Mac</strong> select <strong>Command</strong> <strong>+</strong> or <strong>–</strong> and in a <strong>PC</strong> select <strong>Control</strong> <strong>+</strong> or <strong>–</strong>.</p>
<p>To add an annotation, you simply draw a box around the section you want to feature. For now, put your name, a dash, and give the annotation an appropriate title (don’t just put “Annotation Title” like I am). I am eventually going to have you get rid of your names, but I need them there for now to help me keep track of things.</p>
<p>Because you are zoomed in the formatting of the page is off and, therefore, I recommend that you first mark all of the annotations you want to add and then add the actual annotations once you can readjust the page. Once that’s done you can zoom back out by selecting <strong>Command</strong> <strong>–</strong> <strong>on</strong> a <strong>Mac</strong> or <strong>Control</strong> <strong>–</strong> on a <strong>PC</strong>. Here you can see the three different annotations that I have created. The connect box is where the actual annotations are added.</p>

    <div class="w3-twothird w3-container">
<h1><strong>Creating Line Breaks in Annotations</strong></h1>
<p>Notice the title and the annotation are on the same line, which makes it a little hard to read. To fix this we are going to add a little bit of HTML. Click on the paper clip icon to edit the annotations. To fix this we are going to add the HTML tag for line break next to the annotation title. The tag looks like this <strong>&lt;br /&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>Now when you hover over the annotation the title and annotation are on two different lines.</p>

<h1><strong>Adjusting the Annotation Box</strong></h1>
