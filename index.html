      <p>To sign in to Scalar you are going to use your LMU email address and the password given to you. Click on the person icon in the upper right corner of the page and sign in.</p>

      <p>To get to your project, click your name on the temporary table of contents page. All of your pages (your intro, your archival documents, and your works cited page) should be there already.  If something is missing or wrong, let me know right away.</p>
      <p>All of these pages are connected by what is called a path, which is function in Scalar. Let me know if you would like me to change the order of your archival documents.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">ScalarDashboard:</h1>
      <p>Scalar has a dashboard that might confuse you. If you end up here it’s probably because you accidently click on the wrench icon. The dashboard is how you access a lot of things like the site’s media and pages, but you’re not going need to work in it. I have set up the site so that you only have to work in your exact pages. <strong>To get out of the dashboard and back to the regular site, click on “back to book” in the upper right corner.</strong>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Editing the Intro and Works Cited Text:</h1>
      <p>To edit the text on your intro and works cited pages, click on the pencil icon in the upper right corner. Adding and editing text in Scalar works like most other online tools. It's similar to Wordpress, for example.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Cutting and Pasting From a Word Doc</h1>
      <p>Because Word formatting is not always compatible with other tools, it is best to stripe the formatting. To do this click Source, found just above the text box on the left.  Paste the text and then click Source again. When Source is selected you are seeing the raw text view—this is the view you work in when adding things like html. When Sources is not selected, you are seeing the more visually friendly view, which is why I recommend you work with it unselected. </p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can cut and paste your Word doc text into a text editor and then paste it into Scalar.</p>

      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Formatting Text:</h1>
      <p>Once the text is cut and pasted into the text box you can format it. Like a typical text tool, Scalar lets you do things like add italics and boldface. </p>
