<h1>Scalar - How To</h1>

<h2>Signing into Scalar:</h2>
<p>To sign in to Scalar you are going to use your LMU email address and the password given to you. Click on the person icon in the upper right corner of the page and sign in.</p>

  <h2>Accessing Your Project:</h2>
<p>To get to your project, click your name on the temporary table of contents page. All of your pages (your intro, your archival documents, and your works cited page) should be there already.  If something is missing or wrong, let me know right away.

All of these pages are connected by what is called a path, which is function in Scalar.
 
Let me know if you would like me to change the order of your archival documents.

Dashboard: 
Scalar has a dashboard that might confuse you. If you end up here it’s probably because you accidently click on the wrench icon. The dashboard is how you access a lot of things like the site’s media and pages, but you’re not going need to work in it. I have set up the site so that you only have to work in your exact pages.

To get out of the dashboard and back to the regular site, click on “back to book” in the upper right corner.

Adding Text:
To edit the text on your intro and works cited pages, click on the pencil icon in the upper right corner.

Adding and editing text in Scalar works like most other online tools. It's similar to Wordpress, for example.

Because Word formatting is not always compatible with other tools, it is best to stripe the formatting. To do this click Source, found just above the text box on the left.  Paste the text and then click Source again. When Source is selected you are seeing the raw text view—this is the view you work in when adding things like html. When Sources is not selected, you are seeing the more visually friendly view, which is why I recommend you work with it unselected. 

Alternatively, you can cut and paste your Word doc text into a text editor and then paste it into Scalar.

Formatting Text:
Once the text is cut and pasted into the text box you can format it. Like a typical text tool, Scalar lets you do things like add italics and boldface. 



Saving:
Always save your work. If you select just “save” you will stay on the editing page. If you select “save and view” it will save the information and take you to the page view.

Annotations 
To add and edit annotations, go to the archival document you want to annotate and click on the paper clip icon found in the upper right corner.

When you first land on the annotation page you’ll see that the image is really small. This is a flaw in Scalar. To work around it I recommend you zoom in the webpage. To zoom in and out of a web page on a Mac select Command + or – and in a PC select Control + or –

To add an annotation, you simply draw a box around the section you want to feature.

For now, put your name, a dash, and give the annotation an appropriate title (don’t just put “Annotation Title” like I am).

I am eventually going to have you get rid of your names, but I need them there for now to help me keep track of things. Because you are zoomed in the formatting of the page is off and, therefore, I recommend that you first mark all of the annotations you want to add and then add the actual annotations once you can readjust the page.

Once that’s done you can zoom back out by selecting Command – on a Mac or Control – on a PC.

Here you can see the three different annotations that I have created. 

The connect box is where the actual annotations are added. 

Using the X Y axis plus and minuses and the Width and Height plus and minuses you can adjust the position of the annotation box on the page as well as its size. 

Once you’re done with an annotation click save and then done. Notice the title and the annotation are on the same line, which makes it a little hard to read. To fix this we are going to add a little bit of HTML. Click on the paper clip icon to edit the annotations.

To fix this we are going to add the HTML tag for line break next to the annotation title. The tag looks like this <br />

Notice if you just hit done, it will tell you to hit save.

Now when you hover over the annotation the title and annotation are on two different lines.


Deleting Annotations:
To delete an annotation, make sure you have selected the correct one and click the minus button at the bottom of the annotations list.

Editing Archive Documents Title
To edit the title of the archival document, click on the pencil icon in the upper right corner, and change the title in the title field.
